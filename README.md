# RSA-Blind-Signature
A RSA Blind Signature implementation based on the example code from the Crypto++ wiki, based on Chaum's paper.

[Here is the example we're starting with](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Raw_RSA#RSA_Blind_Signature)  
[Here is the documentation for the underlying Crypto++ library](https://www.cryptopp.com/docs/ref/)  
[Here are instructions for installing and building the underlying Crypto++ library on Linux](https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Linux#Build_and_Install_the_Library)


TODO:
- âœ“ Link to instructions for installing the underlying library and getting this code running.
- Upgrade the hash to a FDH or SHA512.
- Upgrade the keys to 2048 bits or more.
- Seperate into three functions.
- x Seperate into three files?
- Provide instructions for building (installing?) this code.
